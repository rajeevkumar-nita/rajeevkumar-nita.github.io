## 🚀 Deployment Notes
⚠️ 404 Issue on Page Refresh

If you encounter a 404 Not Found error when refreshing routes like /projects or /blog,
it is due to client-side routing in React.

Create a file named vercel.json in the root directory and add:
```bash
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/"
    }
  ]
}
````
